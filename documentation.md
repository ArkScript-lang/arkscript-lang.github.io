## Building and installing

*Nota bene*: the project was made to work only on 64 bits computers, meaning that it can not (and will never) work on 32 bits computers. 64 bits CPU appeared in the 1990s and allow developpers to use more RAM (from a few GB to thousands of TB), while 32 bits CPU appeared in 1960s, they shall now be replaced.
